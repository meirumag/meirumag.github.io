**N: Please introduce yourself in terms of what your interests are, what you’re up to in your life, what your background is.**

H: My name is Han. I’m a student and I’m interested in going into medicine and becoming a doctor one day. I just transferred to Cal [University of California, Berkeley], so that’s really exciting. As for other interests, I’m really into art in terms of visual or creative activities. Also, for a long time, I worked at this store called The Bone Room, where we sold bones, insects, fossils, lots of dead things. My time there has been a big part of my identity, too.

**N: Would you consider yourself “first generation?"**

H: I’m not sure. Even though I was raised in America, my family came here from Burma before I was even one [year old]. I was raised in America from birth, practically, but I was still considered a foreigner. I felt shorted, because I didn't even get to experience living in another country but I wasn’t a citizen of the place that I considered my home. So in some ways, I feel my experience is more similar to my other friends who immigrated from Burma when they were like five or seven [years old]. However, unlike them, I wasn’t impacted by growing up in Burma because I don’t remember living in Burma at all.

**J: What was your experience like throughout grade school?**

H: It was rough. I moved every year until third grade, so I didn’t have any friends. I just I hung out with my two siblings a lot. I had a really hard time connecting with other students because of cultural differences. I never went to schools with large Asian populations, so relating to people was hard. For a long time, I really wanted to be white, just to relate. I have a distinct memory from first grade, when I was trying to tell a story that involved a clothes irons. I didn’t know what those were called, so I kept talking about the “clothes-flattening machine.” Everybody just looked at me with confusion.

**J: How would you try to blend in?**

H: So many ways. In fourth grade, I had these two friends and one of their mothers made Raggedy Ann Halloween costumes for them. So, of course, I tried to make my own. My mom took me to Goodwill, and I desperately tried to find clothes that looked like they could pass for a Raggedy Anne costume. But who the fuck is Raggedy Anne? My mom definitely didn’t know. Thinking about that time still makes me so sad because I was just trying so hard. I just wanted to be in that group with them. Afterward, I remember that friend’s mom told me to just let her know if I wanted to to dress up like my friends. It was nice that she said that, but it also confirmed my fears that I was trying to be so much like them so much that even that mom noticed.

**N:** **It’s hard as a kid, because the number one value is usually to blend in. Kids don’t want to stick out.**

H: I was always trying to hang out with the popular group in elementary school. The group was all the white girls. Despite eventually not being the new kid anymore, I still felt very “othered.” I was in their group, but not really. They all hung out with each other without me.

**N:** **Would you describe your personality as extroverted or introverted?**

H: I was way more extroverted. I think I just did it for attention. I was extroverted, because I could get attention or prove my worth by being goofy or pulling all these stunts and pranks. For example, I had this crush on this guy named Carl Jacobs. Everyone had a crush on him. I cut out a picture of his face and put it on a print-out of Naruto. I don’t know why I did that. I just remember getting in trouble for it.

**J: You mentioned that you got into Naruto through the Burmese community****.** **How were you introduced to the Burmese community?**

H: Most of the Burmese people in the Bay Area know each other, because many of them went to school together in Burma. In larger, older Asian communities, like the Chinese community in the Bay Area, not every single Chinese person knows each other. The Burmese community hasn’t reached that critical mass of anonymity yet.

**N: Is that suffocating in a way?**

H: Yes, but my generation is not as connected with each other. But, for example, my parents are very active in the Burmese community. There was always this pressure on me to also rise up to the occasion. They would make me speak at rallies. I was ten years old, and I didn’t know what I was doing.

**N: Political activism?**

H: Yeah, because they were against the existing Burmese government. I’d speak at these rallies and go to board meetings. When I was 11 [years old], my dad decided to make me run a half-marathon for Burma, because I played soccer. It was really physically demanding. So every weekend I spent three hours training for this damn half-marathon.

**N: How would you describe their mission?**

H: That’s a good question. They were that unorganized. It was spreading awareness about the situation in Burma with the dictatorship and human rights violations. There were a lot of political prisoners that were tortured and killed. Aung Suu Kyi, the national hero, was under house arrest. In 1988, there was this crackdown on protests, and the government killed a bunch of students. In 2008, there were similar protests and the government murdered a bunch of monks, which is crazy because Burma is a really Buddhist country. A large population in Burma is Buddhist, but they were killing [them]. The group spread awareness of these issues through several annual events, including benefits with guest speakers, food, and fundraising.

**N:Were these events in America?**

H: Yeah. A lot of people in that organization were exiles. They left because they feared for their lives, but they continued to be active here in America. Many of them, like my dad, could not go back to Burma because unspeakable things would happen to them if they did. The political situation has since improved a lot. It used to be a military dictatorship, but they just recently began their first democratic government. So my dad has been back several times in the last few years. But the first time that he went, I was pretty afraid. I wasn’t sure that he’d come back, but he did.

**J:These are all extracurricular activities that your parents would put you in. Was this reflected in other parts of your life?**
H: They were really harsh on my academics. They always told me I needed to get good grades, but they didn’t really understand enough to support any of my academic progress. It’s not because they didn’t care, but because they didn’t think to do it. I’ve never had a really good relationship with my dad. He’s really strict and harsh. I was pretty depressed by the time I was in high school. I was getting C’s and D’s and that created a lot of strife in my life, in terms of the relationship between me and my father. But he eventually backed off, because my depression escalated and I actually tried to commit suicide in sophomore year of high school. So after that, they backed off.

**N:The action itself speaks a lot.**
H: I don’t think I really, really wanted to die, but I definitely didn’t know what else to do in that situation. They backed off, but by then my depression had hit full force. And even though there was less pressure from them, I also put a lot of pressure on myself. Socially, I had a falling out with my best friend and that was really hard. I just felt lost, and it took me a while to get back to where I am now.

**J: You recognize that you were depressed during that time. Do you know where the depression stemmed from, where it sprouted from?**
H: It was honestly the relationship with my father. He put me under a lot of pressure. Since he was one of the leaders of this activist organization, he wanted his children—me specifically—to also be just like him. I think he felt that his pride was at stake, and that took a toll on me. Every weekend, I’d get dragged to some meeting for this group. I never played with my friends from school; instead I was constantly doing everything that he wanted me to do. If I ever refused to do something, he would just go off on me and yell at me. We butted heads on everything. Yelling is the only form of communication my parents were taught. It’s pretty common in Burmese culture to not have any tolerance of any sort of disrespect, no matter how small. My parents admitted to me that they fucked up on me, so they were much nicer to my siblings when they taught them.

**J: After your parents waned down on the pressure, what happened afterwards for junior and senior year of high school?**
H: Junior year was definitely the hardest year of my life. I was depressed, and I was on medication. Now that I’m a junior in college, I just can’t believe it’s been four years from the time that I tried to commit suicide.

**N: Did you start seeing a therapist?**
H: Yeah, I did, and then I stopped seeing them. I just felt too depressed to live, but too scared to do anything about it. You’re scared to die. I was in a crazy limbo of just existing. Every single step forward was really hard, but I had no other other options. I had already tried to kill myself, but I couldn’t do it. And I also took five AP classes during junior year.

**J:** **Did you know how hard that was?**
H: I mean I knew, but I was still stubborn and tried to do it all. Junior year was the year where I just slept and didn’t go to class. And I had this huge falling out with my best friend, the only fight I ever been in with a friend. In sophomore year, we were partners in the debate club and she was mad at me because I was a shitty debate partner. I don’t know what happened, but tensions rose and we stormed out of the classroom and swearing at each other in the hallways. I was yelling at the top of the lungs. She didn’t talk to me for the rest of year. Reflecting on it now, she was also going through some things.

**J:** **Were people aware that you were depressed in high school?**
H: I think my friends knew, but my teachers were not supportive. I don’t think they cared. I told them about my depression, but I didn’t tell them I was in the hospital. Maybe I should have? The other day I had this conversation with my friend about the saddest moment in high school. She asked me about the time that I was rolling on the ground and crying at the park, and all of my friends were watching and freaking out. I seriously don’t remember that. Eventually I’ll process that, but [right now] I don’t remember much from junior year.

**N:** **What helped you during that time?**
H: The Bone Room helped me a lot. I felt unproductive and lost at school, but it felt rewarding to be good at a job and get a paycheck every two weeks. My boss was always supportive while also really critical, but I cared about my job so I wanted to do good work.

But what really started to help me was senior year. During this time, I wasn’t taking medication properly so I stopped taking it. I don’t recommend that as medical advice. But it turned out okay. This was around the time that I started to want to be a doctor. I decided I wanted to go to community college. I found goals to be passionate about. Having that direction definitely helped me. Every day I made a hard effort to be happy and forgive myself for anything. I was just trying to be really supportive of myself and change my mindset. In the beginning, I would congratulate myself with candy if I got out of bed in the morning or if I had conversation with someone. I stopped getting down on myself and internalizing all this negativity.

**N:** **It’s amazing that that was four years ago, but even between sophomore year and senior year, there was a huge change.**
H: Yeah, it wasn’t easy. [laughs] Moving out and coming to community college was great. I was so ready to be out of high school. So done. The day after the grad night party, I moved into my current apartment and started working five days of week. So there was this 👏🏽 slap 👏🏽 instant transition into my new life. I had two jobs: one at The Bone Room and the other as a receptionist at this dermatologist office. I was living alone at 17 [years old]!

**J:** **What was your main motivation to move out?**
H: I just needed space. Being in that environment, around my family, was really stressful to me. If my dad wasn’t yelling at me, he was yelling at my mom. Or just yelling. It was really toxic. I also didn’t have my own space. We moved into a two-bedroom place, so my dad had one room, while my mom, sister, brother, and I shared the other room. I moved into the living room midway through junior year. After those first three months of being moved out, they saw that I was happier. And I think they were happier.

I think that’s where I’m at right now: exploring. I feel very much like a blank slate. In junior year, I really shut down all these facets of myself and stopped doing a lot of things. Now I’m in this stage of re-discovery, re-connecting with culture and hobbies. Even with the activism thing, for a while, I was like, “fuck it I don’t want to be an activist.” I’m not really passionate about many causes. I rejected them for so long because I associated them with things I was forced to do as a child. But I’m trying to develop that differently now, and the clinic has been a really great thing for that.

**J:** **So senior year, you said that after getting out of depression, you found goals. And one of those goals was medicine. What attracts you to medicine?**
H: After working at the Bone Room and doing customer service, I realized that I enjoy talking to a variety of people, helping people, and serving them. I also like fine motor skills. At the Bone Room, we’d skin specimen, so I got a really good understanding of anatomy and the physical handling of bodies. In terms of problem-solving, I like science in general, but I would never want to do research. I don’t love anything enough that I’d want to study it that intently. I’d rather learn something and then apply it to more practical, hands-on things, such as directly helping people. So it’s a combination of all of those things, and it was around the time that I started working for this dermatologist. I saw her as a role model for all of that. I wanted to be someone like her.

**J:** **What specifically inspired you?**
H: Just the way that she interacted with people. Her demeanor was very assuring and guiding. I imagine myself being happy doing that: helping patients, talking to them, getting to know them. The idea that as a doctor, I could meet a variety of different people—that’s what I want. That’s one of the aspects that I like about customer service: I get to talk to everyone and know a little bit about them. It would be really rewarding to do.

**N:** **How has your clinic experience reinforced or added more dimension?**
H: I’ve been thinking about something another volunteer said the other day. He was talking about the dynamics between doctors, nurses, and physician’s assistants. He was reflecting on how nurses are the ones who interact with people and help them. Whereas a doctor’s job is to come in and make sure that they absolutely know everything. They just swoop in, determine what the issue is, and then they leave. So, which one do I want to be? The way he describes [a doctor’s job], it isn’t actually what I want to do, but when I see [the doctor at the clinic], I feel like that’s not representative of what she does. So I need to explore that more.

**N:** **I think about that it, too. For anyone interested in a clinical profession, it’s a matter of defining for oneself what it means to be truly at a patient’s advocate. Is the focus on being there for them constantly, without fail? Or is it about focusing on competency with a person’s illness and underlying factors?**
H: At the clinic, we’re taught to “see” the person not the illness, but I think as a doctor you’re taught to see the illness and focus on it. All your studies and schooling revolve around the illness. Part of me feels like healthcare should not be structured in that way. That shouldn’t turn me away from being a doctor.

**N:** **What’s your perspective on your parent’s mental health? Your mom specifically?**

  H: My mom’s mental health is a whole other story. My mom got 5150’d because she tried to commit suicide, too. When she was seven or eight, her mother got murdered in a market in Burma in front of her. I think that kind of thing affected her for her whole life. Her family grew up poor in Burma. She got married to my father, the first person that she has ever been with. She’s always been anxious and a little bit disconnected. Last year, she started developing this paranoia. It started with her thoughts about people at the bank and how they were suspicious of her and her money. Then it turned her belief that people at Safeway were talking about her. I got really mad, because it was scary to hear that. She once ran away to her friend’s house in Fremont. We and other families were quickly there, because word spreads fast. We were sitting in the living room, and my mom was freaking out, all shaky and looking spacey. Everybody said that she was just going through menopause. Her friends bought her menopause medication. I was getting so mad obviously. I was told everyone that she needs to go to a hospital. She needed help. Nobody listened to me. It was that day that my dad was like, let’s just fix it by being a family and have a family dinner with hot pot. My dad then yelled at me at the dinner table, and that’s when my mom tried to stab herself with a knife at the table. It was in front of my little sister, who was ten years old at the time. It just made me so mad on so many levels. She finally got to the hospital, which was good, but she doesn’t speak English that well, and I think that the types of therapy that were offered to her were just really didn’t click. In terms of language or even values. I really just pulled away from my family during the whole time that that was happening. She was in the hospital for three weeks, but I only visited her once. I just couldn’t do it. I think this situation’s really reflective how mental health in Burmese culture is commonly dealt with.


**N:** **It’s so heavy. Because you are still learning how to cope with your own mental health, even at that time, with all of that to carry. That’s what I’m realizing, too, in growing up, I’m understanding my parents in a way that they’re not necessarily conscious of. That “bearing witness” concept: if you’re bearing witness to that, are you responsible for it, in a way? Can I be responsible for something like that? It’s crazy.**
H: It’s crazy to process all of this and realize that your parents are real complicated people with their own problems.

**J:** **I’m seeing a pattern of first generation kids growing into the concept of happiness at an earlier age than their parents. I asked my parents whether they were happy, because it doesn’t seem that way to me. I’m also afraid, because I don’t want to be the person to suggest a divorce. But then again, they don’t really have a good grasp of what they define as happiness in their life. It’s this weird rift because when you’re young, they’re your guardians. Now you’re older and teach them these things.**
** **
**N***: Are our concepts of happiness and mental health even the best?**
**
***J:** **It’s more of a mindset of thinking more critically about how to define as happiness. For me, if you really want to figure this out, you have to think about it. But for my dad and mom, after a certain age, it seems like they don’t want to think about hard things in life anymore.** **They don’t say it, but I feel like they don’t want to talk about those things.**  **It also can get really heated, because there’s this filial piety going on and you want to respect your elders. You don’t want to make them angry, but at the same time, conflict isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Conflict can be healing. But it’s not really a very well-grasped concept in a lot of the Asian cultures.**

******How’s your mom now?**

My mom’s been doing better. But sometimes there’s a dip and she’ll go back, and I’ll just look at my siblings faces and I can see the fear. And they can see the fear in mine. I don’t want to go through this again. I think they’re going to be okay, but I worry about my sister a lot. The other two other women in her family tried to kill themselves—what kind of role models are those? What is it to grow up like that? That’s terrible. But, I mean, that’s her reality. Nothing is going to change that. She said to me the other day, yeah I hear my friends’ problems, but now that I’ve been through this, they don’t know what real problems are. So I get this sense that she doesn’t have people to relate to around something like this.

**J:** **Even if there is another classmate with a similar experience, how can they talk about it intelligently?** *****We’re still learning how to have those conversations even now.**
 **
**N:** **What’s the relationship with your siblings like? Did you feel a sense of leaving them behind at all?**
Not really, just because they’ve always had different relationships with my parents. I think it’s been a lot easier for them. By the time we had settled down, my sister was just born and my brother was starting kindergarten. So they spent their whole lives in Albany, unlike me. Also, as the first child, my parents were a lot harsher with me, and they eventually realized that some of the things they were making me do were unreasonable. They let my brother play video games all day. He gets away with everything.
 **
**What have romantic relationships been like?**
I keep it very separate. My parents don’t approve of me dating. I wouldn’t have told my mom except she freaking saw me smiling at my phone. She was like, “you have a boyfriend, don’t you?” I’m a really bad liar, so I start getting all flustered and she found out. For things like sex, I think both of my parents think I’m a virgin, or they really hope that I’m a virgin and won’t entertain other thoughts. When I told my mom that I was trying to get birth control, we had a very vague conversation. She never said the word “sex.” I do not even know the word for “sex” in Burmese, because I’ve never heard it spoken. That’s how little it’s discussed ever.

**Did you share a lot to your boyfriends about your family at all?**
Yeah, I’m pretty open. When my mom tried to kill herself, I called my boyfriend at the time. I wanted to see him, and I wanted his support. But then he started crying, too, and I was like, “motherfucker, you can’t cry!” But, in general, it’s nice to have someone to talk to. I’ve tried to be as open as possible.

**For relationships, some people look to have someone with a similar background or values. Is that something that you look for in a partner?**
I think I would avoid Burmese people. Even my mom doesn’t want me to marry someone Burmese. Burmese men are raised in a culture in which women are subservient to them. My mom has been second to my father ever since they got married, and that’s not something that I want for myself.

**How would you characterize Burmese guys that have grown up in America?**
In the experience that I’ve had, the women are more open to challenging the Burmese way of thinking, more interested in challenging the status quo. I think the men are more okay with Burmese social hierarchy and dynamics.

**The measures of success here in America are so different as a woman. To be somebody who might be bridging those two things, is tough.**
As a woman, in Burma, our national hero is a woman. But our society is so damn sexist. I honestly don’t understand how they reconcile those two things. Because I don’t think they’d tell Aung Syuu Kyi to fuckin’ do the dishes for you. You wouldn’t tell her to be quiet and behave like a lady. But why is it okay to tell every other Burmese woman that? It’s really weird.

**In general, the Burmese identity, how much do you define yourself that way?**
I think about that a lot actually. I do have a lot of anger towards Burmese culture. It’s super xenophobic and a little hypocritical. One example is that in Burma, there’s a Rohinga ethnic minority group that is Muslim. They’re being ethnically cleansed, but nobody in Burma cares because they’re Muslim. But at the same time, these same people are activists who fight for human rights. It makes me so mad.

**Because they “other” them.**
I don’t want to be associated with that kind of mindset. At the same time, it is my culture, and that is something that I do want to keep with me. It’s where I’m from, and it’s a part of me. It’s something I want to maintain, be proud of, and pass onto my children.

**How do you imagine that happening, passing that off to the future generation?**
I’m going to give my children Burmese middle names. I would teach them about Burma. Like, let’s try to cook this Burmese dish together. Let’s learn a little bit about the history. But honestly, I’d be learning, too. There are honestly a lot of holes in my understanding of it. I feel like all the strife with my father has led me to reject my Burmese identity.

**In terms of culture, I thought that if I don’t hold onto it, we’ll lose it. It can feel like the opportunities are slipping through our fingers. But I don’t think it’s quite true. There’s always a way to rediscover it, to dig it up.**
That’s a good point. Can I interact with my culture separate of the community here and the way I was raised? Is that a valid exploration of it? What if I just Google searched “Burmese history” and read about it? It might be impersonal and removed, but maybe that’s how I want to interact with my heritage, through my own discovery.
