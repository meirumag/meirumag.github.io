#### N: Please introduce yourself in terms of what your interests are, what you’re up to in your life, what your background is.

H: My name is Han. I’m a student and I’m interested in going into medicine and becoming a doctor one day. I just transferred to Cal [University of California, Berkeley], so that’s really exciting. As for other interests, I’m really into art in terms of visual or creative activities. Also, for a long time, I worked at this store called The Bone Room, where we sold bones, insects, fossils, lots of dead things. My time there has been a big part of my identity, too.

#### N: Would you consider yourself “first generation?"

H: I’m not sure. Even though I was raised in America, my family came here from Burma before I was even one [year old]. I was raised in America from birth, practically, but I was still considered a foreigner. I felt shorted, because I didn't even get to experience living in another country but I wasn’t a citizen of the place that I considered my home. So in some ways, I feel my experience is more similar to my other friends who immigrated from Burma when they were like five or seven [years old]. However, unlike them, I wasn’t impacted by growing up in Burma because I don’t remember living in Burma at all.



#### J: What was your experience like throughout grade school?

H: It was rough. I moved every year until third grade, so I didn’t have any friends. I just I hung out with my two siblings a lot. I had a really hard time connecting with other students because of cultural differences. I never went to schools with large Asian populations, so relating to people was hard. For a long time, I really wanted to be white, just to relate. I have a distinct memory from first grade, when I was trying to tell a story that involved a clothes irons. I didn’t know what those were called, so I kept talking about the “clothes-flattening machine.” Everybody just looked at me with confusion.

#### J: How would you try to blend in?

H: So many ways. In fourth grade, I had these two friends and one of their mothers made Raggedy Ann Halloween costumes for them. So, of course, I tried to make my own. My mom took me to Goodwill, and I desperately tried to find clothes that looked like they could pass for a Raggedy Anne costume. But who the fuck is Raggedy Anne? My mom definitely didn’t know. Thinking about that time still makes me so sad because I was just trying so hard. I just wanted to be in that group with them. Afterward, I remember that friend’s mom told me to just let her know if I wanted to to dress up like my friends. It was nice that she said that, but it also confirmed my fears that I was trying to be so much like them so much that even that mom noticed.

#### N:It’s hard as a kid, because the number one value is usually to blend in. Kids don’t want to stick out.

H: I was always trying to hang out with the popular group in elementary school. The group was all the white girls. Despite eventually not being the new kid anymore, I still felt very “othered.” I was in their group, but not really. They all hung out with each other without me.
