## Meiru Mag: Hey Jessica! Let’s have you start by telling us a bit about yourself and where you grew up.

Jessica: My name is Jessica. I’m 24 years old, and I’ve been out of college for about two years now. I’m an engineer here in the South Bay. I like to do artsy things, and I’m interested in languages. I like cultures. I grew up in Southern California and spent most of my life there. I went to college here in the South Bay and went back home for a year after college.

## M: How do you identify in terms of ethnicity?

J: My mom is ethnically Chinese and culturally Indonesian. My dad is African American. So, I tend to identify as Indonesian and African American. It’s one of the first ways that I identify myself whenever there’s a “What are you?” conversation. I usually first ask back, “Can you guess what I am?” And then people are normally surprised when I say half-Chinese or half-Asian. It’s something that I’ve talked about a lot with people. People are always curious:

* Oh, how was it growing with two different culturally different parents?

* How did they meet?

* Is your mom a “tiger mom”?

My ethnicity is just another instance of talking about how I grew up. I don’t really find it weird or different.

## M: How have those conversations felt for you, now and beforehand?

J: When I was growing up, people always thought it was a cool thing, like I had the best of both worlds.

* Oh you’re really smart, you got that from your Asian side.

* Oh you do sports like track, it makes sense because you’re black, too.

And I roll with it, but it’s not why I’m doing those things. Those qualities are not necessarily related to race at all. But people otherwise  seem to react pretty positively to me being mixed race.

## M: Did those comments come from peers or adults?

J: They mainly came from peers. In elementary school, that stuff didn’t really register among kids. In middle school, people started realizing to the  oh you’re half this, half that, that’s cool. Those comments about sports and being smart were from high school times. In college, people asked more in-depth questions.

* Oh what exactly is Indonesian culture?

* Do you speak Indonesian? Do you speak Chinese?

People would be interested. I’ve had very few bad experiences with people, in regards to racism, fortunately.

## M: How have you seen your mom and dad communicate their cultures to each other?

J: My dad learned a lot about Indonesian culture by eating the food. My mom would cook for us a lot when I was growing up. When my mom was a Seventh Day Adventist, my dad would come with us to church, so he was able to get to know a lot of the community as well.

My mom moved to America from Indonesia when she was thirty years old. And then soon after, she started her life and had a family. That was actually a big transition for her. My mom’s introduction to America was simply being in America and having incidents with cultural differences, such as discovering a lot of the rules in America. In Indonesia when she was growing up,, there weren’t as many laws, or the laws weren’t as strict. My impression from her and my dad’s early marriage stories were along the lines of her trying to do something and then my dad would be like, no you can’t do that. And she’s like, sure you can. And he’d be like, not in America!

## M: What did she try to do?

J: For instance, there is a certain process to being able to drive. First, you’d need a driver’s license, and then you’d have to pass a driving test. But my mom would just drive. And my dad’s like, wait you need to—

## M: It’s true. The car doesn’t tell you that you need to have a license.

J: Or even the traffic rules, driving rules, the concept of driving lanes, how to drive…Buying a car, too. People will rip you off everywhere but differently depending on the country. My mom is really good at picking up on bullshit in Indonesia, but in America, she wasn’t as good because the culture is different. So my dad was always worried about that. She bought a car and was ripped off. And my dad was like, “what?! why did you go buy a car by yourself?”

That’s another thing that I noticed between my parents. My mom was the eldest in her family, so she was super independent, used to being the breadwinner and taking care of all her younger siblings and her mom. When she was in Indonesia, people went to her for advice, and she always knew what to do and how things worked. My dad was also the eldest in his family and grew up with the social structure in which the man is the head of the household. And so they always butted heads on that.

## M: How did they communicate?
J: I think he was just frustrated with her. [laughs] I don’t think it went over very well. Looking back, I wish he was more patient, but it’s hard to be patient when you’re dealing with such serious things. It must have been really stressful and probably hard on their marriage. 
## M: As a kid, did you ever have to be put in a position where you had to explain something to your mom or dad?
J: I did have a hard time explaining the concept of extracurricular activities. I think Indonesia is pretty conservative when it comes to women, so my mom didn’t understand why I was doing sports. She was like “that’s for boys, isn’t it?” So I was like, “Well, here it’s not.” But it bothered me that she didn’t really get it [laughs]. 

My dad would actually just take care of most of those things though, so it was helpful. When it came to those things, my dad would explain them briefly, and my mom would be like “Whatever, it’s fine, you’re going to take care of it.” I feel like my mom always felt a “me vs. them” mentality because I was growing up in America and my dad was American. Sometimes she felt like she couldn’t connect in the same way.

## M: Going back to your conversations with peers about your ethnic background, when was the first instance that you recognized your ethnicity as distinct from other people?

J: I’d say maybe middle school. Before that, it was normal for me to move throughout these spheres: my dad’s side of the family, people from school, people from church, and my mom’s friends. It was just normal. And then, in middle school, I saw other people who were mixed race. I was like “ooh, that’s like…me.” They were mixed with different ethnicities and, more specifically, different types of Asians. Saying “half-Asian” was not enough. So I’d say “Oh yeah, I’m half-Indonesian.” And then I think I had a conversation with my mom at one point where I was telling her about this. And she was like “oh, we’re Chinese, too” and I was like “wait what?” I never registered that my mom was ethnically Chinese. I thought she was an Indonesian born in Indonesia. So it was middle school that I found out that my mom was ethnically Chinese.

## M: Yeah, it’s complex. My aunt is Indonesian, and I didn’t even know Indonesia was a country until my mom had to explain it to me. I had thought that Indonesia was a part of China because she’s my aunt. She lives in Hong Kong now, and gets a lot of discrimination because her accent stands out.

J: That is one of the things that I liked about Indonesia. They celebrated differences. If you were different, they wouldn’t say “oh that’s bad.” They would be like “oh that’s pretty cool.” When I was in China, I got a lot of stares, but maybe it’s because of the area that I was in. I was in Shanghai and Beijing, big populous cities, but for most of the time I was in southern China. I just generally felt like I was under a microscope or a zoo exhibit. I was just walking beside a lady, and she took a video of me. I didn’t get that vibe when I was in Indonesia. I think people will stare anywhere, but in general, maybe it is how I interpret the culture as well. In terms of my family noticing that I’m not a native Indonesian nor Chinese and that I’m part black, it wasn’t even a thing. In a lot of families, they care about marrying within your culture, within your race, but it was really nice to know that my family just cared whether I was a good person. My hair is curly, so people are like “oh my gosh, I’ve never seen hair like this,” and they would be like, that’s so cool!”

## M: How was the experience when you went to Indonesia and you met your Indonesian family?

J: It was pretty cool. I went with my mom. My mom is not as easygoing as most people, so my initial assumption was that my family was like her. But when I got there, they were all super chill, way chiller than my mom. I had to reconfigure what I thought being Indonesian was. I had to separate my mom and her personality from the entire culture.

I found that, in Indonesia, it’s like you’re in a giant community. They’re very nationalistic, and if not nationalistic, very proud of whichever island they come from. There are 17,000 islands, but not all of them are inhabited or have their own culture. But there are various islands, like Java, where the capital city of Indonesia is, Jakarta. There’s Medan, there’s a very distinct culture there as well. Manado, Surabaya, all of these places have a distinct culture based on whether they were colonized by the Dutch, Spanish, or French. So it was really interesting to see that. A lot of people in Jakarta are Chinese Indonesian so you have Chinese Indonesian people, you have people from Manado, from Surabaya, from all the other islands. So I guess, Indonesia is divided but overall I felt like it was a community. You can just hail someone down and they’ll help you. The driving is crazy, because the infrastructure is not all that great and it’s still a developing country. People are rude when they drive but I didn’t feel like they were rude to be rude. They genuinely care if they hit you or not. If you’re crossing the street, you’re like, hey i’m crossing, and they’ll stop. They’re really thoughtful in that way. 

## M: How was your relationship with your mom, with the two of you together in Indonesia?

J: She was way more at ease and much happier because she missed her friends, family, culture, and food.  She was really happy to be surrounded by foods and fruits that she could readily access, because though one can create a community in a different country, a country can’t be wholly recreated in a different country. It’s a tropical country so fruit is a really big thing for her, her generation, and older generations. She hadn’t been back in a long time either, so it was really nice to see that in her. But also somewhat sad for me to realize, because she spent 25 or 26 years being unhappy in America and having to adjust culturally. I could see how that took a toll on her, and it can be part of the reason why she’s not as easygoing as my family members. 

## M: Is there a reason why your father didn’t go to Indonesia?
J: My grandma was living with us and we basically didn’t want to leave her alone. And also my mom is not a really good traveler so he didn’t want to deal with that stress. The first two times that I’ve been to Indonesia, we went as a family. And then this is the time that the two of us went last year.

## M: Did you two go mainly because you just haven’t been there in a while?
J: Partially, but also a cousin of mine was having a wedding. A lot of family was planning to be there for the wedding, including a long lost family member, my grandmother’s brother. My great-grandparents lived in China, and they gave up one of their daughters for adoption to an Indonesian lady. There was perhaps some omen surrounding her birth that made her unlucky, so my grandmother grew up in Indonesia. That’s where the divide developed between the Chinese culture and Indonesian culture in my family. So my mom really wanted to meet her uncle, her Chinese uncle, that no one had ever seen basically since my grandmother was given up for adoption. It was cool to see my grandmother meet her brother for the first time. My grandmother is in her seventies, and it was really cute because they’re both small old people. Language was somewhat of a barrier, but we did have a family member who spoke both Indonesian and Chinese. It was still cool to see them unite and still enjoy each other’s company even though they couldn’t have a full conversation. What was important that they still saw each other. There’d have to be another big family event for them to see each other again. 

## M: After seeing the difference for your mom being in the states and Indonesia, is your relationship now changed?

J: It hasn’t changed too much, but on my side, I understand her more. If anything has changed, it’s because I’ve fully moved out of the house. That’s more of a transition for the parents’ relationship with their daughter in not having to financially support her. But this trip was really good because we have extended family in Indonesia and on the east coast. Them knowing that we had travelled to Indonesia, gave us visibility. After this trip, my mom was reminded that, yeah I have people here, there are people here, I can visit them, I can keep in touch. It gave her a social motivation to keep reaching out to family members here in the United States. Last month, we had some Indonesian relatives visit New Jersey, which is where my my mom’s sister lives, so we visited them. Now my mom has been more family-oriented, and now I’ve seen more of my family. We’re getting more face time. So I wouldn’t say that my relationship with my mom changed so much as my relationship and position in my family has changed. And changed for the better.

## M: You’ve had the opportunity to travel abroad in different Asian countries. Do you feel like that affects the consciousness of your identity, being here in the Bay Area now?

J: It doesn’t change my identity but I think it does change how conscious I am about my identity in different situations. Somehow, my identity is defined in this way but now that I’ve been to these three countries in the last four years, like somehow there’s more depth to my identity. With every trip I take, I learn about another culture, but I also learn how to compare and contrast cultures and have a more nuanced perception of my own identity and an appreciation for others’ identities. It’s very complex. There are people who grow up in one country and then straight up move to another; that’s one identity. There are people who grow up in one country, learn English for the most of their life, and then move to America. That’s another thing, where you have more of a transition. And then there are people who have both parents who are Chinese for instance, and they’re born in America. That’s a different experience. One parent who’s Chinese, one who’s American, and then that’s another experience. I can just appreciate all these different experiences.

## M: When people say “first-generation,” that can be mean different things.
J: And it makes a difference if you know the language of that culture, that country, as well.

## M: Depending on what age you move here, your experience is drastically different. Would you say equally identify with black culture and Indonesian culture?
J: At various points of my life, I identity more as one than the other. It depends on my experience really. If I don’t spend much time with my Indonesian family, then I feel like, in America, people perceive me as black. I just identify as black. When I fill out forms, I pick “black” if it says one. If you can pick more than one, then I pick Asian as well. But as I spend more time with my mom and her family, then I identify more with being Indonesian or Asian. But I’ve never felt like I’m more Asian than Black for some reason. I’ve always felt either more Black than Asian or equally so. I think it’s that’s just because in America, I look black. Like if someone just looked at me, they wouldn’t guess that I’m Asian, most of time. That plays a role.

## M: Has it ever come to a time where those two cultures conflict?
J: I wouldn’t say so. Not specifically the cultures, but both sides of my family maybe. My paternal grandma lived with us for a while. There were some incidents, sometimes on a daily basis, between her and my mom. Part of it was a cultural difference, and part of it was the difference in their ages and their life experiences. I feel like family and in-law relationships aren’t always the best sometimes. So there’s that. I, personally, haven’t had any incidents where I felt the cultures conflicted. I’ve never had an internal dialogue, “Am I black or am I Asian?” I’ve always felt that I’m both. Sometimes I feel like I’m one more than the other.
## M: How’s your range of emotions with that type of situation? Do you usually welcome people who have ready questions or conversations about your identity? Or is there a point of a “hey guys, shut up” type of thing? 
J: I am a little more impatient with people who are like “Oh what are you?”, because it’s a question you get a lot. It’s as if someone has a funny name, and people make a joke out of it. That person always hears that everywhere they go, the same joke over and over again. So, simple questions don’t get on my nerves, but, I mean, they are questions that I have to answer again and again. If people ask more in-depth questions or are more curious, I tend to welcome and appreciate that a bit more. It shows that they’re somewhat culturally aware. I mean, if people start asking me what I am, and then proceed to ask more questions, that’s definitely welcome as well. I found that a lot people don’t know that much about Indonesian culture. Many questions I get that are like, “oh so the language it’s Bahasa, right?” Indonesian, yeah, that’s the language.

## M: Would you ever want to move to Indonesia?
J: I wouldn’t want to move there. But I know my mom has wanted to move back because that is her home. I’ve spent my entire life here in America. This is my home. I would visit Indonesia again but I don’t feel like I would invest a lot of my life in the country. It would be to see the people. I would go back in the next couple of years, either by myself or with my mom or with both my mom and dad, to visit family and to see other things in Indonesia, like Bali or Medan.
## M: Thinking inter-generationally, how would you communicate these things that you learned about yourself? Because we wonder about this, too, with our future kids and grandchildren, how much can we really pass on?

J: Yeah that’s something I’ve been thinking about, too. Indonesian is not my first language. I would not be able to teach my child Indonesian unless I was in an Indonesian community or if my mom lived close by and talked to my child a lot. I’m not sure, but I know that I want to expose my children and even my housemates to different cultures. It’s also an excuse to learn more Indonesian things. Like, hey, this is a part of my culture, I’m still learning about it and on my journey to learn more about it. I’m going to check out this place, I have an emotional cultural tie to this—do you all wanna come with me? Let’s go make a new experience and learn. That’s how I view it.
